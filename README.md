### Pre requisites

- Node.js: Install Node.js on your development machine. React Native requires Node.js to run JavaScript on the server side and to manage dependencies.
- npm or Yarn: npm (Node Package Manager) is included with Node.js. Alternatively, you can use Yarn as a package manager. Both are used to install and manage dependencies for your React Native project.
- Code Editor: Choose a code editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write your React Native code. Some popular options include Visual Studio Code, Atom, and Sublime Text.

### Technologies used:

- React Native: The core framework for building cross-platform mobile applications.

- Expo: A set of tools and services that helped streamline the development and testing process.
- React Navigation: A popular library for handling navigation within the app.
- Axios: A powerful HTTP client for making API requests and consuming the supplied endpoints.
